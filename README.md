# Introducing FocusBuild

**FocusBuild** is the first blockchain-based productivity dApp and city-building game, built for the [Solana Mobile Stack](https://solanamobile.com/).

Walk through the current design [prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/KAMiD8jZHfC8so6ZKsobGZ/FocusBuild?node-id=293%3A716\&scaling=min-zoom\&page-id=89%3A495\&starting-point-node-id=293%3A716) or view a video of it below. Track Github updates [here](https://github.com/FocusBuild/FocusBuild).

### The Problem

Let's face it. For many, modern mobile smart devices are a large source of everyday distraction, making it difficult to get the work we need done, harder to remain present in real life, and depleting arguably one's most valuable resource: **attention**. Literature in the field of attention have found, for example, that multitasking results in a [significant decrease in task performance](https://educationaltechnologyjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41239-018-0096-z) and that humans generally overestimate how well they can multitask, that students focus for [less than 6 minutes ](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0747563212003305)before task-switching if device if it was within reach, and feelings of attachment [anxiety](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0747563214002805) when devices are unexpectedly unavailable. Simply [limiting accessibility](https://d1wqtxts1xzle7.cloudfront.net/39356054/Conquering-Digital-Distraction-with-cover-page-v2.pdf?Expires=1666987258\&Signature=BrnumQQTok52qb3UIxomZL9UCTPlNd6rKkw2ze8P-OC3LZs7WqQpjd-h8fGew6i0arLd0TeiUnKetivQ6yXKqvR704D8S5rYyM60zt9x7nYBNbC52bPDe5oGiNIcYqhZu3I\~fIDpvM5jP0tyvR8HMsVZ5FvrvJTeXuByF9KFnoN0svAXvoPN1Z\~F1k3hf3JVQ-RQXW3c5aKg3AjemEbYxk9nIFFhWR24fj7xGJ-xan0ejgumNo\~NTo9suDg8xgi9lJRWrCksP2MeGHx2A6llydciAxVdFXxA86gzsi\~aUzKGlD5y7iWEW042WFsIYBzVDl5PqcJG-j6ZSUoqq-bxKw\_\_\&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLOHF5GGSLRBV4ZA) is the best way to address these range of problems, as many intuitively know.&#x20;

While most standard mobile productivity apps aimed toward time management and intentionally limiting phone access have allowed users to track their progress and encourage positive phone habits, few have designed a reward system that works as well as an existing app called **Forest**.&#x20;

To use Forest, users simply set the timer for however long they want to focus, and once the timer starts, a tree begins to plant. If the user leaves the app, their plant "withers" - if the user completes the timer without leaving the app, they are rewarded their plant, which is shown in their own virtual forest, which displays the entire history of focus sessions they've succesfuly completed via their planted trees, **allowing users to tangibly see the progress they've made in a visually appealing way.**&#x20;

This very simple concept, coupled with appealing graphics and users' wide selection of plants they can chose has allowed Forest to reach _#1 in Productivity in the App Store, and over 10M downloads in the Play Store._ **But users' productivity data, including the valued visual reminders of their progress, are tied to an email account and connected to Forest the **_**company**_**, creating risks for erasure and censorship.**&#x20;

### **Project Description**

**FocusBuild** is the first productivity mobile application that upgrades this proven concept by bringing this value on-chain, so users will always be able to access their visual progress from wherever and whenever, without any permission. In addition, it is also the first mobile application to incentivize healthy habits with one's phone through it's native cryptocurrency - an opportunity only viable through a trustless, decentralized ledger. While remaining primarily a productivity application, FocusBuild adds an additional layer of enjoyability via strategic city-building, and uses an NFT-system and Game-Fi mechanics inspired by existing "x-to-earn" models, with a strong emphasis on **long-term usability and enjoyability**. See [Tokenomics and Revenue Model.](tokenomics-and-revenue-model.md)

### **Application Use**

Users select their _**Builder** -_ a unique non-fungible token with various _**attributes**_** ** - to build _**structures**_ during a FocusBuild.&#x20;

FocusBuild = an amount of time intentionally set by the user where the user doesn't leave the application, else their structure is demolished.&#x20;

When a FocusBuild session is completed _successfully_, users are rewarded the _**structure**_ they’ve chosen which serve as a tangible reminder of their time without distraction **stored on-chain.**

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-10-12 at 2.33.17 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Builder and Attributes</p></figcaption></figure>

Structures are placed onto the _**City Map**_ - a unique non-fungible token that displays the user's historical productivity progress via the structures that have been built and placed and stores their productivity data (i.e. total time and structures). When a FocusBuild session is completed successfully, users also earn FocusBuild’s in-game cryptocurrency, _**Concentrate**_. _**Concentrate**_ is spent on:

1. Leveling up _Builder Attributes_ to make them more efficient at generating structures and earning more Concentrate.
2. Unlocking unique in-game-features, such as new or premium structures.

Once adequately developed by _**structures**_ _and_ total accumulated FocusBuild time from non-Base Builders \[see description below], _**Cities**_ can be upgraded to the next **Tier,** allowing them to be _staked and activated_ in the _City Staking Pool_ resulting in a boost on the _**Concentrate**_ earned by a Builder during FocusBuild. Cities cannot be rapidly developed simply by paying for Concentrate because structures must be built during FocusBuild, and Cities can only adequately develop via a combination of total accumulated FocusBuild time in addition to structures.&#x20;

For more details on _**Builders**_ and _**Cities**_, continue to [Game Mechanics.](game-mechanics/)

**Base Builder NFTs**&#x20;

Base Builders can be minted for **.1 SOL** for users who want to enjoy the application strictly without Concentrate rewards and City Tier upgrading. While Base Builders can still create structures to develop their City, **they will not earn Concentrate,  do not have attributes,** and the **Base Focus Build Time** for the City Structure is **not counted when upgrading City Tier.** &#x20;
