# Introducing FocusBuild

**FocusBuild** is the first blockchain-based productivity dApp and city-building game, built for the [Solana Mobile Stack](https://solanamobile.com/).

Walk through the current design [prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/KAMiD8jZHfC8so6ZKsobGZ/FocusBuild?node-id=293%3A716\&scaling=min-zoom\&page-id=89%3A495\&starting-point-node-id=293%3A716), or [view](https://vimeo.com/manage/videos/764746260) the walk-through.

### The Problem

Let's face it. For many, modern smart devices are a large source of everyday distraction, making it difficult to get the work we need done, harder to remain present in real life, and depleting arguably one's most valuable resource: **attention**. Literature in the field of attention have shown that, for example, students focused on studying for [less than 6 minutes ](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0747563212003305)before switching to an available technological distractor, multitasking results in a [significant decrease in task performance](https://educationaltechnologyjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41239-018-0096-z), and growing feelings of [anxiety](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0747563214002805) when phones aren't accessible for increased amounts of time. Most importantly, research has shown that simply [limiting accessibility](https://d1wqtxts1xzle7.cloudfront.net/39356054/Conquering-Digital-Distraction-with-cover-page-v2.pdf?Expires=1666987258\&Signature=BrnumQQTok52qb3UIxomZL9UCTPlNd6rKkw2ze8P-OC3LZs7WqQpjd-h8fGew6i0arLd0TeiUnKetivQ6yXKqvR704D8S5rYyM60zt9x7nYBNbC52bPDe5oGiNIcYqhZu3I\~fIDpvM5jP0tyvR8HMsVZ5FvrvJTeXuByF9KFnoN0svAXvoPN1Z\~F1k3hf3JVQ-RQXW3c5aKg3AjemEbYxk9nIFFhWR24fj7xGJ-xan0ejgumNo\~NTo9suDg8xgi9lJRWrCksP2MeGHx2A6llydciAxVdFXxA86gzsi\~aUzKGlD5y7iWEW042WFsIYBzVDl5PqcJG-j6ZSUoqq-bxKw\_\_\&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLOHF5GGSLRBV4ZA) is the best way to address this problem.

While most standard productivity applications aimed toward time management and limiting phone accessibility have given users a way to track time and see user progress, few have designed a reward system that works as well as an application called **Forest**. To use Forest, users simply set its in-app timer for however long they want to focus on whatever they're doing, and once the timer starts, a tree begins to plant. If the user leaves the app, their plant withers - if the user completes the timer without leaving the app, they are rewarded their plant, which is shown in their virtual forest. Their forest displays via their planted plants the entire history of focus sessions they've succesfuly completed, **allowing users to tangibly see the progress they've made in a visually appealing way.** This very simple concept, coupled with appealing graphic design and users' wide selection of plants they can chose has allowed Forest to reach _#1 in Productivity in the App Store, and over 10M downloads in the Play Store._

**But users' productivity data, including the valued visual reminders of their progress, are tied to an email account and connected to Forest the **_**company**_**, creating risks for erasure and censorship.**&#x20;

### **Project Description**

**FocusBuild** is the first productivity mobile application that upgrades this proven concept by bringing this value on-chain, so users will always be able to access their visual progress from wherever and whenever, without any permission. In addition, it is also the first mobile application to incentivize healthy habits with one's phone, which is only viable through a trustless, decentralized ledger. FocusBuild utilizes an NFT system and Game-Fi mechanics inspired by existing "x-to-earn" models, but with a strong emphasis on **long-term usability and enjoyability**. See [Tokenomics and Revenue Model. ](tokenomics-and-revenue-model.md)\[In Progress]

Users use their _**Builder** -_ a unique non-fungible token - to build _**structures**_ during a FocusBuild session: a predetermined amount of time where the user doesn't leave the application. When a FocusBuild session is completed successfully, users are rewarded the _**structure**_ they’ve chosen. _**Structures**_ serve as a tangible reminder of their success without distraction stored on-chain.

Structures are placed onto the _**City Map**_ - a unique non-fungible token that displays their historical productivity progress via the structures that have been built and placed. When a FocusBuild session is completed successfully, users also earn FocusBuild’s in-game cryptocurrency, _**Concentrate**_. _**Concentrate**_ is spent on:

1. Leveling up _Builder Attributes_ to make them more efficient at generating structures and earning more Concentrate.
2. Unlocking unique in-game-features, such as new or premium structures.

Once adequately developed by _**structures**_ and total accumulated FocusBuild time, _**Cities**_ can be _staked and activated_ resulting in a boost on the _**Concetrate**_ earned by a Builder in a FocusBuild. Cities cannot be rapidly developed simply by paying for Concentrate because structures must be built during FocusBuild.
