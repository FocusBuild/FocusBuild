# Introducing FocusBuild

**FocusBuild** is the first blockchain-based productivity dApp and city-building game, built for the [Solana Mobile Stack](https://solanamobile.com/).

Walk through the app's design [prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/KAMiD8jZHfC8so6ZKsobGZ/FocusBuild?node-id=293%3A716\&scaling=min-zoom\&page-id=89%3A495\&starting-point-node-id=293%3A716) or view a video of it below.&#x20;

### The Problem

Modern mobile smart devices are a large source of everyday distraction, making it difficult to get the work we need done, harder to remain present in real life, and depleting arguably one's most valuable resource: **attention**. Literature in the field of attention has found that multitasking results in a [significant decrease in task performance](https://educationaltechnologyjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41239-018-0096-z) and that humans generally overestimate how well they can multitask, that students focus for [less than 6 minutes ](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0747563212003305)before task-switching if a device was within reach, and feelings of attachment [anxiety](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0747563214002805) when devices are unexpectedly unavailable. Simply [limiting accessibility](https://d1wqtxts1xzle7.cloudfront.net/39356054/Conquering-Digital-Distraction-with-cover-page-v2.pdf?Expires=1666987258\&Signature=BrnumQQTok52qb3UIxomZL9UCTPlNd6rKkw2ze8P-OC3LZs7WqQpjd-h8fGew6i0arLd0TeiUnKetivQ6yXKqvR704D8S5rYyM60zt9x7nYBNbC52bPDe5oGiNIcYqhZu3I\~fIDpvM5jP0tyvR8HMsVZ5FvrvJTeXuByF9KFnoN0svAXvoPN1Z\~F1k3hf3JVQ-RQXW3c5aKg3AjemEbYxk9nIFFhWR24fj7xGJ-xan0ejgumNo\~NTo9suDg8xgi9lJRWrCksP2MeGHx2A6llydciAxVdFXxA86gzsi\~aUzKGlD5y7iWEW042WFsIYBzVDl5PqcJG-j6ZSUoqq-bxKw\_\_\&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLOHF5GGSLRBV4ZA) is the best way to address these range of problems, as many intuitively know.&#x20;

While most standard mobile productivity apps aimed toward time management and intentionally limiting phone access have allowed users to track their progress and encourage positive phone habits, few have designed a reward system that works as well as an existing app called **Forest**.&#x20;

To use Forest, users simply set the timer for however long they want to focus, and once the timer starts, a tree begins to plant. If the user leaves the app, their plant "withers" - if the user completes the timer without leaving the app, they are rewarded their plant, which is shown in their own virtual forest, which displays the entire history of focus sessions they've succesfully completed via their planted trees, allowing users to **tangibly** see the progress they've made in a **visually appealing** way **** and giving a satisfying, extrinsic reward to reinforce a positive habit they want to build**.**&#x20;

This simple concept, coupled with appealing graphics and a wide selection of plants for users to choose from, has allowed Forest to reach _#1 in Productivity in the App Store, and over 10M downloads in the Play Store._ **But users' productivity data, including the valued visual reminders of their progress, are tied to an email account and connected **_**offchain**_** to Forest company, representing centralized risks of privacy loss, erasure, and censorship.**&#x20;

### **Project Description**

**FocusBuild** is the first productivity mobile application that upgrades this proven concept by bringing this value on-chain, so users will always be able to control their self-improvement at any time and place, without relying on a corporation's executive permission. In addition, FocusBuild is the first mobile application to incentivize healthy habits with one's phone through its native cryptocurrency - an opportunity only viable through a trustless, decentralized ledger. While remaining primarily a productivity application, FocusBuild contributes an additional layer of engagement via strategic city-building and uses an NFT-system and Game-Fi mechanics inspired by existing "x-to-earn" models, with a strong emphasis on **long-term usability, enjoyability, individual player expressivity and satisfaction**. See [Tokenomics and Revenue Model.](tokenomics-and-revenue-model.md)

### **Using the App**

Users select their _**Builder** -_ a unique _non-fungible token_ with various _**attributes and rarities**_** ** - to build _**structures**_ during a FocusBuild.&#x20;

FocusBuild = an amount of time intentionally set by the user where the user doesn't leave the application, else their structure is demolished.

When a FocusBuild session is completed _successfully_, users are rewarded a _**structure**_ stochastically determined by how long the timer was initially set for. Structures serve as a tangible reminder of users's time without distraction **stored on-chain.**

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-10-12 at 2.33.17 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Builder Selection and Attributes</p></figcaption></figure>

Structures are placed onto the _**City Map**_ - a non-transferrable [**soul-bound** **token**](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-are-soulbound-tokens-the-non-transferrable-nft-explained/) representing the user's historical productivity progress - via completed and placed structures - and stores this productivity data (i.e. total FocusBuild time and structures) on-chain.  We highly prioritize making structures unique, diverse, and visually beautiful so that users will have a satisfying and permanent representation of their accomplishment.  We're exploring scalable methods to make this possible and machine learning with stable diffusion or other approaches seems promising.  Like Builders, structures will have a variety of attributes including **building type,** **rarity, complexity, and architectural style.**  Completed buildings will provide to bonuses to future building and minting when placed in a city and that city is equipped.



Along with the built structure, when a FocusBuild session is completed, users also earn FocusBuildâ€™s in-game cryptocurrency, _**Concentrate**_. _**Concentrate**_ is tentatively spent on:

1. Leveling up _Builder Attributes_, such as efficiency at creating certain structures, likelihood of creating a structure with certain aesthetics, speed of building.
2. Upgrading buildings
3. Unlocking unique in-game-features, such as new or premium structures.

**Base Builder NFTs**&#x20;

Base Builders can be minted for **.1 SOL** for users who want to enjoy the application strictly without Concentrate rewards and Specialized Aesthetic Categories. While Base Builders can still create structures to develop their City, **they will not earn Concentrate,  do not have attributes,** and the **Base Focus Build Time** for the City Structure is **not counted when upgrading City Tier.** &#x20;
