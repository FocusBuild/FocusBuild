# Building Community

## Incentivized **City Showcase Competitions**

&#x20;Previous games have proven that players are only willing to pay for cosmetic attributes if they can be shown off (e.g. CS Go's Skins, World of Warcraft's cosmetic Armor, Fortnite skins, etc.). To engage the community and add a sense of socialization, FocusBuild will implement City Showcase Competitions. Additionally, an option to visit a random person's City or a friend's City, FocusBuild and "Focus Together" option where Builder's can Build together.&#x20;
