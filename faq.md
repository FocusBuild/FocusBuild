# FAQ

**Q: What is the goal of the project?**

The goal for FocusBuild is to create a top-tier, blockchain-based mobile application that encourages healthy phone habits and enables people to focus on what really matters to them in real life. &#x20;

**Q: With the variety of  structures you build, do they serve unique purposes? Or are they fully aesthetic?**

We’re building a productivity app, you can’t interact with the structures except for placing them on your City Map. This isn’t Sims, its a work of art.  Structures are selected before a user starts FocusBuild and rewarded upon a successful Build, they cannot be purchased. On the technical side, Structures are not their own NFT Smart Contract, but metadata within either the Builder or CityMap, depending if the Structure is completed.  Currently, the Structures available are Residential Building, Road, with more coming in the future. Interactions of the structures or structure placement are outside of the initial scope of the product, but it is a possibility in the future.

**Q: Can I buy Structures from the Marketplace?**

Structures cannot be bought on the marketplace, in-game or on-chain - that would make it too easy to build a City. In this special productivity game, long term frequent activity, Leveling up your Builder, making it more productive to build structures and improve your City. Those with Tier A Cities are a very small group. It’s not easy to build a City, and it’s not Easy to Upgrade it up to the next CityTier. Though, what you can do is level up your Builder to increase its Attributes, accumulate better builders etc. by spending Concentrate.

**Q: How does leveling up my Builder work?**

Users spend Concentrate to level up their Builder. Once done, they are given a point to level up one of their Attributes:

1. Energy - Determines how much FocusBuild time Builder has before it must Rest&#x20;
2. Earning Rate - Determines the base rate at which Builder earns Concentrate during Focus Build
3. Rest Time - How much time the Builder must Rest before doing a new FocusBuild.

**Q: Can a user "game the system" by doing many small focus sessions to build many structures, rapidly developing the City?**

Cities have a minimal amount of structures and time accumulated into them. Please see the City Tier Table.

**Q: Is there a Durability component to Builders? As in, does its earning rate decrease if the Builder has been used many times?**

No. At this time, Builders' earnings base rate do not decrease from their current level.  However, When Energy is depleted, Builder’s must Rest. Users can Rest their Builder by waiting a certain period of time determined by their Rest, or by spending Concentrate tokens.

**Q: Can I still use the focus timer and build a building even when my Builder doesn’t have enough Energy? For example, I want to focus for 60 minutes, but my Builder only has 30 minutes of Energy left.**

Yes, you can still use the timer for 60 minutes. In this case, the Builder will begin building after 30 minutes have passed, and will use the rest of its Energy on that structure. After its energy is depleted, the Builder must now rest, determined by its recovery time

**Q: Where is structure Data stored when in Inventory state and when on Map state? Can you hack the timer to spam create many structures?**

A project like STEPN was hard to hack because it used location data to verify user integrity. For FocusBuild hackers may try and find a way to spam mint structures. There is a decentralized security measure that restricts people from hacking the timer if they found a way. We aim to verify that Structures aren’t built by the same Builder at the same time. The Builder Smart Contract ensures that only one structure is built at a time.This is what differentiates us from Forest, and allows us the security to place real monetary value in the game.&#x20;

**Q: Man, this is a  lot of info. I thought this was a productivity app!**

The best way to play the game is to not think about it too much!
