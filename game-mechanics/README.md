### _Attributes_

1. **Energy** - Determines how much FocusBuild time Builder has before it must Rest&#x20;
2. **Earning Rate** - Determines the base rate at which Builder earns Concentrate during Focus Build
3. **Rest Time** - How much time the Builder must Rest before doing a new FocusBuild.

### _Classes_

An immutable characteristic of Builders and are divided into 4 groups&#x20;

1. **Common**
2. **Uncommon**
3. **Rare**&#x20;
4. **Ultra Rare**

They set the minimum and maximum Attribute levels of the Builder.

### _Types_

**Day** - Optimal Concentrate Earnings during FocusBuild's 45 minutes or less.

**Night** - Optimal Concentrate Earnings during FocusBuild's 45 minutes or greater.

**Structures make up the city and are earned when a FocusBuild is completed. In terms of the types of structures and their 3D-Animated Design, the sky is the limit!**
