# Builders

**Initial Mint and Supply:**

TBD.



### Attributes:

FocusBuild Builders are diversely characterized by a variety of attributes that enable a wide range of player expression and specialization.

* **Rarity** - Determines strength of other attributes
* **Specialty** - Builders will specialize in some architectural style(s) based on their background. &#x20;
* **Traits** - Builders can have buffs or debuffs to certain styles and types
* **Build speed** - Ratio of productivity throughput to a base builder
* **Energy** - Determines the max capacity of FocusBuild the Builder has before it must Rest.&#x20;
* **Rest Time** - How much time the Builder must Rest before doing a new FocusBuild. Concentrate can be spent to fully rest a builder immediately (Fast Rest).&#x20;

### Builder Level

When a Builder reaches a set amount of accumulated FocusBuild Time, users can spend Concentrate to increase its **Builder Level**. The builder then gains attribute points which can be spent to level up one of the builder's Attributes.  The separation of attribute and builder levels allows players to specialize builders for certain tasks.  For instance, a player who wants a city with diverse architectural styles might avoid leveling up a builder's specialty and instead spend points on build speed or favorable traits whereas speciality, energy, and rest time would boost a player's construction of buildings of a single style for a more aesthetically uniform city.

### Attribute Levels

Players can spend concentrate to upgrade attributes other than rarity, improving their numerical values.

### _Builder Rarity_

An immutable characteristic of Builders and divided into 4 groups&#x20;

| Rarity     | Chance of Minting |
| ---------- | ----------------- |
| Common     | 84%               |
| Uncommon   | 10%               |
| Rare       | 5%                |
| Ultra Rare | 1%                |

**Rarities determine Attribute values given the current Attribute Level.** For example, a Rare Builder with a Level 5 Energy Attribute will always have higher Energy than a Common Builder with a Level 5 Energy Attribute, etc.  In the case of specialization, rarer builders will be more likely to build rarer structure styles and have sharper probability distributions.



### _Types_

**Day** - Optimal Concentrate Earnings during FocusBuild's 45 minutes or less.

**Night** - Optimal Concentrate Earnings during FocusBuild's 45 minutes or greater.

### **Rarity x Attributes Statistics \[Table Under Construction]** &#x20;



| Rarity | Level | Attribute | Value    |
| ------ | ----- | --------- | -------- |
| Common | 1     | Energy    | 30 min.  |
| Common | 2     | Energy    | 35 min.  |
|        |       |           |          |

### Base Builders&#x20;

Base Builders can be minted for **.1 SOL for users who want to enjoy the application strictly without Concentrate rewards** but still want to enjoy having their productivity data on-chain. While Base Builders can still create structures to develop their City, **they will not earn Concentrate,  do not have attributes,** but still have an associated **total Focus Build Time**
