# Builders

### Overall Level

When a Builder reaches a set amount of accumulated FocusBuild Time associated with it, users can spend Concentrate to increase it's Overall Level. As a result, users chose which Attribute to level up.

### **Attributes**

1. **Energy** - Determines the max capacity of FocusBuild the Builder has before it must Rest.&#x20;
2. **Earning Rate** - Determines the base rate at which Builder earns Concentrate during Focus Build.
3. **Rest Time** - How much time the Builder must Rest before doing a new FocusBuild. Concentrate can be spent to fully rest a builder immediately (Fast Rest).&#x20;

### _Rarity_

An immutable characteristic of Builders and are divided into 4 groups&#x20;

| Rarity     | Chance of Minting |
| ---------- | ----------------- |
| Common     | 84%               |
| Uncommon   | 10%               |
| Rare       | 5%                |
| Ultra Rare | 1%                |

Rarities determine Attribute values given the current Attribute Level. For example, a Rare Builder with a Level 5 Energy Attribute will always have higher Energy than a Common Builder with a Level 5 Energy Attribute, etc.&#x20;

### _Types_

**Day** - Optimal Concentrate Earnings during FocusBuild's 45 minutes or less.

**Night** - Optimal Concentrate Earnings during FocusBuild's 45 minutes or greater.

### Base Builders&#x20;

Base Builders can be minted for **.1 SOL** for users who want to enjoy the application strictly without Concentrate rewards and City Tier upgrading. While Base Builders can still create structures to develop their City, **they will not earn Concentrate,  do not have attributes,** and the **Base Focus Build Time** for the City Structure is **not counted when upgrading City Tier.** &#x20;

Cities

Cities are a visually appealing, tangible representations of the progress one's made focusing, stored on-chain. When a structure is built, they appear in the Inventory. From there, users place the structure onto their map, further developing their city.&#x20;

**Structures make up the city and are earned when a FocusBuild is completed. In terms of the types of structures and their 3D-Animated Design, the sky is the limit!City Tier | Boost Table \[Under Construction]**
