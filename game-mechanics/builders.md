# Builders

_UPDATE: Earning Levels - which increase the Concentrate a Builder earns per minute during FocusBuild - will unlikely be in current the game design. In order to prioritize long-term enjoyability, we want to avoid early players having a strictly unfair advantage of increasing their rate of Concentrate earned, which would increasingly disincentize new users from playing. Instead, we decide to go the direction of increasing Builder and Structure diversity._

###

### Initial Mint and Supply

TBD.

### Overall Level

When a Builder reaches a set amount of accumulated FocusBuild Time associated with it, users can spend Concentrate to increase it's **Overall Level**. As a result, users chose which Attribute to level up - Energy and Rest Time are the Builder's current Attributes.&#x20;

### **Attributes**&#x20;

1. **Energy** - Determines the max capacity of FocusBuild the Builder has before it must Rest.&#x20;
2. **Rest Time** - How much time the Builder must Rest before doing a new FocusBuild. Concentrate can be spent to fully rest a builder immediately (Fast Rest).&#x20;
3. ~~**Earning Rate** - Determines the base rate at which Builder earns Concentrate during Focus Build.~~    &#x20;

&#x20;       **Specialization -** Determines the [Special Aesthetic Category](structure-variation-or-animation.md#special-aesthetic-categories) of the structures the builder builds.&#x20;

### _Attribute Rarity_

An immutable characteristic of Builders and divided into 4 groups&#x20;

| Rarity     | Chance of Minting |
| ---------- | ----------------- |
| Common     | 84%               |
| Uncommon   | 10%               |
| Rare       | 5%                |
| Ultra Rare | 1%                |

**Rarities determine Attribute values given the current Attribute Level.** For example, a Rare Builder with a Level 5 Energy Attribute will always have higher Energy than a Common Builder with a Level 5 Energy Attribute, etc.



Rarity also determines the probability that the structure created by the Builder is of the Builder's Aesthetic Specialty.

### _Types_

**Day** - Optimal Concentrate Earnings during FocusBuild's 45 minutes or less.

**Night** - Optimal Concentrate Earnings during FocusBuild's 45 minutes or greater.

### **Rarity x Attributes Statistics \[Table Under Construction]** &#x20;



| Rarity | Level | Attribute | Value    |
| ------ | ----- | --------- | -------- |
| Common | 1     | Energy    | 30 min.  |
| Common | 2     | Energy    | 35 min.  |
|        |       |           |          |

### Base Builders&#x20;

Base Builders can be minted for **.1 SOL for users who want to enjoy the application strictly without Concentrate rewards** but still want to enjoy having their productivity data on-chain. While Base Builders can still create structures to develop their City, **they will not earn Concentrate,  do not have attributes,** but still have an associated **total Focus Build Time**

Cities

Cities are a visually appealing, tangible representations of the progress one's made focusing, stored on-chain. When a structure is built, they appear in the Inventory. From there, users place the structure onto their map, further developing their city.&#x20;

**Structures make up the city and are earned when a FocusBuild is completed. In terms of the types of structures and their 3D-Animated Design, the sky is the limit!City Tier | Boost Table \[Under Construction]**
