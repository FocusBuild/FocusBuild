# Builders

### **Initial Mint and Supply:**

TBD.

### Builder Attributes

FocusBuild Builders are diversely characterized by a variety of attributes that enable a wide range of player expression and specialization.

**Leveled Attributes**

* **Energy** - Measured in minutes, determines the max capacity of FocusBuild the Builder has before it must Rest.&#x20;
* **Rest Time** - How much time the Builder must Rest before performing a new FocusBuild. Note: Concentrate can be spent to fully rest a builder immediately (Fast Rest).
* **Specialty** -&#x20;

**Static Attributes**

* **Rarity** - Determines strength of other attributes
* <mark style="background-color:red;">**Traits**</mark> <mark style="background-color:red;"></mark><mark style="background-color:red;">- Builders can have buffs or debuffs to certain Structure styles and types</mark>
* <mark style="background-color:red;">**Build speed**</mark> <mark style="background-color:red;"></mark><mark style="background-color:red;">- Ratio of productivity throughput to a base builder</mark>

### Builder Level

When a Builder reaches a set amount of accumulated FocusBuild Time, users can spend Concentrate to increase its **Builder Level,** effectively allowing the user to level up one of the builder's **Attributes Levels**.  The separation of Attribute and Builder levels allows players to specialize builders for certain tasks.  For instance, a player who wants a City with diverse architectural styles might avoid leveling up a Builder's Specialty and instead spend points on Build Speed or favorable Traits whereas Specialty, Energy, and Rest Time would boost a player's construction of buildings of a single style for a more aesthetically uniform city.

### Attribute Levels

Players can spend Concentrate to upgrade Attributes improving their numerical values.

### _Builder Rarity_

"Rarity" is an immutable characteristic of Builders and are divided into 4 rarity groups:

| Rarity     | Chance of Minting |
| ---------- | ----------------- |
| Common     | 84%               |
| Uncommon   | 10%               |
| Rare       | 5%                |
| Ultra Rare | 1%                |

**Rarities determine Attribute values given the current Attribute Level.** For example, a Rare Builder with a Level 5 Energy Attribute will always have higher Energy than a Common Builder with a Level 5 Energy Attribute, etc.  In the case of specialization, rarer builders will be more likely to build rarer structure styles and have sharper probability distributions.



### _Types_

**Day** - Optimal Concentrate Earnings during FocusBuild's 45 minutes or less.

**Night** - Optimal Concentrate Earnings during FocusBuild's 45 minutes or greater.

### **Rarity x Attributes Statistics \[Table Under Construction]** &#x20;



| Rarity | Level | Attribute | Value    |
| ------ | ----- | --------- | -------- |
| Common | 1     | Energy    | 30 min.  |
| Common | 2     | Energy    | 35 min.  |
|        |       |           |          |

### Base Builders&#x20;

Base Builders can be minted for **.1 SOL for users who want to enjoy the application strictly without Concentrate rewards** but still want to enjoy having their productivity data on-chain. While Base Builders can still create structures to develop their City, **they will not earn Concentrate,  do not have attributes,** but still have an associated **total Focus Build Time**
