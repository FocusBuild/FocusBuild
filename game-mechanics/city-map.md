# City Map

## Cities

Cities are a visually appealing, tangible representations of the progress one's made focusing, stored on-chain as _non-fungible tokens_. When a structure is built, they appear in the Inventory. From there, users place the structure onto their map, further developing their city.&#x20;

**Structures make up the city and are earned when a FocusBuild is completed. In terms of the types of structures and their 3D-Animated Design, the sky is the limit!**
