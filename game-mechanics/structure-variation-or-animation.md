# Structures

"Structures" are named intentionally because we think there's potential for them to manifest in a limitless amount of types, different shapes and sizes.&#x20;



These include not only residential houses, but skyscrapers, libraries, churches, hospitals, and roads. Further into development, we will implement structure design to be associated with how long a FocusBuild session is.

## **Time-based Categories**

&#x20;**The Category of a Structure is determined by time, but the specific structure that the Builder creates within the category is random, resulting in a "loot-box," or variable reward, in order to engage user's long term.**  After a successful FocusBuild session, users can chose to spend Concentrate in order to select the specific structure they wanted within their Category.

| FocusBuild Time | Category             | Examples                                      |
| --------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| <20 minutes     | Small Structures     | roads, custom signs, street lights            |
| 20-45 minutes   | Medium Structures    | single story resident homes, small restaurant |
| 45 - 90 minutes | Large Structures     | 2-3 story buildings, highways                 |
| > 90 minutes    | Very Large Structure | libraries, hospitals, 4+ story buildings,     |



## **Aesthetic Categories**&#x20;

The goal for special aesthetics categories is to incorporate **randomness** for the visual look of the structure, and **introduce visual design diversity for Cities**.&#x20;

**3D Animation Design Potential**

3D Design Concepts for Structures below once completed. We are also exploring AI-based 3D Structure creation.
