# Structures

"Structures" are named intentionally because we think there's potential for them to manifest in a limitless amount of Types, Complexities, and Aesthetic Rarity.&#x20;

These Types include residential houses,  skyscrapers, libraries, churches, hospitals, universities and roads.&#x20;

## **Minimum Time Requirements to Build The Structure**

&#x20;**Each Structure has a minimum amount of time needed to build it.**&#x20;

****

| FocusBuild Time | Category             | Examples                                      |
| --------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| <20 minutes     | Small Structures     | roads, custom signs, street lights            |
| 20-45 minutes   | Medium Structures    | single story resident homes, small restaurant |
| 45 - 90 minutes | Large Structures     | 2-3 story buildings, highways                 |
| > 90 minutes    | Very Large Structure | libraries, hospitals, 4+ story buildings,     |

**The Category of a Structure is determined by time, but the specific structure that the Builder creates within the category is random, resulting in a "loot-box," or variable reward, in order to engage user's long term.**  After a successful FocusBuild session, users can chose to spend Concentrate in order to select the specific structure they wanted within their Category.

Chose the type category. Minimum amount of time you take to .&#x20;

e.g. if you chose to build a road the minimum is 20 minutes. but if you decide to invest 1 hour into your road then it is more "complex"

## Structure Attributes

* Style - what aesthetic (culture, time period)
* Rarity - likelihood of creating a specific quality of structure (beauty and detail, quality)
  * Rarity = .9 \* Builder Rarity + +1 \* Time Modifier
* Complexity - Size and Magnitude
  * Complexity = .9 \* Time Modifier + .1 \* Builder Rarity

If you have a rarer Builder, it increases the chances that the Structure made will be more detailed and higher quality. But if you have more time then this changes the size

* &#x20;Time Modifier = Your Timer / Minimum Time&#x20;
  * This Time Modifier is a ratio that contributes to the Rarity and Complexity of the Selected Structure.
  * e.g. Road has a base time cost of 20 minutes. Library has a base time cost of 90 minutes. If I spend 20 minutes on a road, and 90 minutes on a library, they will have a Time Modifier of 1 and share the same Rarity | Complexity Table. But If you spend 40 minutes on a road you will get a more complex and rare road. If you spend 180 minutes on a library, you will get a more complex and rare library.
