# Structures

"Structures" are named intentionally because we think there's potential for them to manifest in a limitless amount of Types, Complexities, and Aesthetic Rarity.&#x20;

These Types include residential houses,  skyscrapers, libraries, churches, hospitals, universities and roads.&#x20;

## **Minimum Time Requirements to Build The Structure**

&#x20;**The Category of a Structure is determined by time, but the specific structure that the Builder creates within the category is random, resulting in a "loot-box," or variable reward, in order to engage user's long term.**  After a successful FocusBuild session, users can chose to spend Concentrate in order to select the specific structure they wanted within their Category.

| FocusBuild Time | Category             | Examples                                      |
| --------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| <20 minutes     | Small Structures     | roads, custom signs, street lights            |
| 20-45 minutes   | Medium Structures    | single story resident homes, small restaurant |
| 45 - 90 minutes | Large Structures     | 2-3 story buildings, highways                 |
| > 90 minutes    | Very Large Structure | libraries, hospitals, 4+ story buildings,     |

Chose the type category. Minimum amount of time you take to .&#x20;

e.g. if you chose to build a road the minimum is 20 minutes. but if you decide to invest 1 hour into your road then it is more "complex"

* Structure Attributes
  * Style - what aesthetic (culture, time period)
  * Rarity - likelihood of creating a specific quality of structure (beauty and detail, quality)
    * Rarity = .9 \* Builder Rarity + +1 \* Time Spent&#x20;
  * Complexity - Size and Magnitude
    * Complexity = .9 \* Time Spent + .1 \* Builder Rarity
* If you have a rarer builder make better and higher quality structure. But if you have more time then this changes the size
* **Your Timer / Minimum Time = Time Modifier**&#x20;
  * **This Time Modifier is a ratio that determines the Rarity and Complexity of the Selected Structure.**
  * e.g. Road has a base time cost of 20 minutes. Library has a base time cost of 90 minutes. If I spend 20 minutes on a road, and 90 minutes on a library, they will have a Time Modifier of 1 and share the same Rarity | Complexity Table. But If you spend 40 minutes on a road you will get a more complex and rare road. If you spend 180 minutes on a library, you will get a more complex and rare library.
