# Structures

## **Time-based Categories**

&#x20;**The Category of Structure is determined by time, but they specific structure that the Builder creates within the category is  random.**  After a successful FocusBuild session, users can chose to spend Concentrate in order to select the specific structure they wanted within their Category.

| FocusBuild Time | Roads                | Examples                                  |
| --------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| <20 minutes     | Small Structures     | roads, custom signs, street lights        |
| 20-45 minutes   | Medium Structures    | single story resident homes               |
| 45 - 90 minutes | Large Structures     | 2-3 story buildings, highways             |
| > 90 minutes    | Very Large Structure | libraries, hospitals, 4+ story buildings, |



## **Special Aesthetic Categories**&#x20;









"Structures" are named intentionally because we think there's potential for them to manifest in a limitless amount of types, different shapes and sizes. These include not only residential houses, but skyscrapers, libraries, churches, hospitals, and roads. Further into development, we will implement structure design to be associated with how long a FocusBuild session is.<img src="../.gitbook/assets/noun-4267809(1) (1).png" alt="" data-size="original">![](<../.gitbook/assets/noun-3222595(1) (2).png>)
